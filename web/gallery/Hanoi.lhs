First, some colors for our disks, and types to represent the data
structures involved.

> colors = [blue, green, red, yellow, purple]
>
> type Disk  = Int
> type Stack = [Disk]
> type Hanoi = [Stack]
> type Move  = (Int,Int)

To render a single disk, draw a rectangle with width proportional to
its disk number, using a color selected from the `colors` list.

> renderDisk :: Disk -> DC
> renderDisk n = rect (fromIntegral n + 2) 1
>                # lc black
>                # fc (colors !! n)
>                # lw 0.1

To render a stack of disks, just stack their renderings on top of a
drawing of a peg.  We use `alignB` to place stack of disks at the
bottom of the peg.

> renderStack :: Stack -> DC
> renderStack s = disks `atop` post
>   where disks = (vcat . map renderDisk $ s)
>                 # alignB
>         post  = rect 0.8 6
>                 # lw 0
>                 # fc saddlebrown
>                 # alignB

Finally, to render a collection of stacks, lay them out
horizontally, using the `Distrib` method so the pegs end up spaced
evenly no matter the width of the disks on any particular peg.

> renderHanoi :: Hanoi -> DC
> renderHanoi = hcat' with {catMethod = Distrib, sep = 7} . map renderStack

Now some code to actually solve the puzzle, generating a list of moves
which are then used to simulate the solution and generate a list of
configurations.

> solveHanoi :: Int -> [Move]
> solveHanoi n = solveHanoi' n 0 1 2
>   where solveHanoi' 0 _ _ _ = []
>         solveHanoi' n a b c = solveHanoi' (n-1) a c b ++ [(a,c)]
>                               ++ solveHanoi' (n-1) b a c
>
> doMove :: Move -> Hanoi -> Hanoi
> doMove (x,y) h = h''
>   where (d,h')         = removeDisk x h
>         h''            = addDisk y d h'
>         removeDisk x h = (head (h!!x), modList x tail h)
>         addDisk y d    = modList y (d:)
>
> modList i f l  = let (xs,(y:ys)) = splitAt i l in xs ++ (f y : ys)
>
> hanoiSequence :: Int -> [Hanoi]
> hanoiSequence n = scanl (flip ($)) [[0..n-1], [], []] (map doMove (solveHanoi n))

Finally, we render a sequence of configurations representing a
solution by laying them out vertically.

> renderHanoiSeq :: [Hanoi] -> DC
> renderHanoiSeq = vcat' with { sep = 2 } . map renderHanoi
>
> example = pad 1.1 $ renderHanoiSeq (hanoiSequence 4) # centerXY
